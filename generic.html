								<h3>ODDR</h3>
								<p>Oddr is an innovative business that pioneers the invoice-to-cash management platform, aiming to revolutionize how law firms handle their invoicing process. Their mission is to centralize, streamline, and accelerate every aspect of invoicing, from bill creation and delivery to collections and reconciliation.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>The Challenge</h3>
								<p>As designers, our mission is to enhance the current website by creating a minimalist and user-friendly design. Our goal is to address existing mistakes and improve clarity throughout the platform.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>The Solution</h3>
								<p>We presented to ODDR with a design solution that is cohesive to their existing design. The team and I made great use of the existing design system and components, but also implemented improvements to provide an overall product that will integrate well the previous project.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Take away and Next step</h3>
								<p>This project taught me the importance of doing your research and doing it properly. Building upon your knowledge by really trying to understand the subject matter will push you to design a successful product. It was a good lesson in staying calm even when the information can be overwhelming. I really just took it one step at a time and before I knew It the team was able to create a design that the client was very satisfied with.
									Communicating often and informing your team on what you're doing also keeps everyone on the same page. it was a rewarding experience overall when we managed to create solutions to any issues that we came across. I also learned that even when challenges arise that you can always ask for help. in return, I would be proactive in making sure I provided any assistance when needed.</p>

								<h4>Branding and Media Advertising</h4>
                 				<p>As an Art director in creative team designs monthly digital visual mock up  campaign and content which in charge of design visual, creates the mood board, selling idea and pitching client's account on Social media which I assigned to work with Pepsi Co.,Thailand as main client includes Doritos, Pepsi and Gatorade.</p>
								 <br>
								 <h3>The Challenge</h3>
								 <p>To understand the clients need, we have organized the process of meeting with client which is the Brief reviews for monthly content so we can discuss and understand deeply about client need. The media team and the account executive may work with us to clarify the customer need and client need at the same time</p>
								 <br>
								 <h3>The Solution</h3>
								<p>The research from the target of each brand is different. The clients tend to have their summary of their own target so that helps a lot to really get in to the right target. After the research, working and designing process is the result for showing the solution and checking the mock up with the clients is to make sure and confirm the work to be released </p>								 <br>
